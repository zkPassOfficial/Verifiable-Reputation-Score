# 🧩 Verifiable Reputation Score (VRS)
### A Coverage-Penalized Multi-Source Reputation Scoring Framework

<br>

## 📘 Overview

The **Verifiable Reputation Score (VRS)** is a **privacy-preserving, proof-based reputation framework** developed for the **zkPass ecosystem**.  
It measures user authenticity, engagement, and contributions across multiple verified data sources while keeping sensitive information private through **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)**.

Unlike traditional single-metric systems, VRS evaluates reputation across several independent dimensions, encouraging a well-rounded and verifiable digital identity.

## 🔑 Core Principles

- **Privacy-Preserving Verification** — Validates achievements using ZK proofs without revealing personal data.  
- **Multi-Dimensional Reputation** — Considers identity, skills, engagement, and influence for a more holistic assessment.  
- **Coverage-Penalty Mechanism** — Rewards users for balanced participation across different platforms.  
- **Cross-Platform Aggregation** — Integrates verifiable credentials from over 25 sources, including social, financial, educational, and creative networks.

## 🧩 Framework Structure

VRS is composed of six major dimensions plus one external social component:

| Code | Dimension | Description | Typical Weight |
|------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **POA** | Proof of Attention | Engagement within zkPass ecosystem | ~14% |
| **POH** | Proof of Humanity | KYC and identity verification | ~14% |
| **POSL** | Proof of Skill | Technical ability and learning progress | ~14% |
| **POSY** | Proof of Society | Network size and community influence | ~14% |
| **POR** | Proof of Reach | Financial solvency and diversification | ~14% |
| **POC** | Proof of Creation | Content creation and creative contributions | ~14% |
| **Yapper** | Social Reputation | Twitter/X engagement score | ~16% |

**Total Score Range:** 0–100 points

## ⚙️ How It Works

VRS aggregates verified credentials from different platforms and evaluates them within each dimension.  
Each dimension is designed with its own weighting and penalty settings to balance depth (within one area) and diversity (across multiple areas).  
Users who maintain activity and verification across several dimensions achieve higher overall credibility scores.

This approach ensures that the reputation system remains transparent, verifiable, and resistant to manipulation.

## 🧮 Scoring Dimensions Summary

- **Proof of Attention (POA):** Measures engagement with zkPass through verified follow, join, or participation actions.  
- **Proof of Humanity (POH):** Confirms authenticity via KYC-verified and age-established accounts.  
- **Proof of Skill (POSL):** Assesses technical proficiency and consistent learning activity.  
- **Proof of Society (POSY):** Evaluates social influence and community presence.  
- **Proof of Reach (POR):** Validates asset ownership and financial credibility without revealing amounts.  
- **Proof of Creation (POC):** Recognizes creators for publishing meaningful content across multiple platforms.  
- **Yapper (Social Reputation):** Integrates a live engagement metric from the Yapper API, focused on Twitter/X influence.

## 📊 Reputation Tiers

| Score Range | Tier | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| **80–100** | Elite | Fully verified across all major dimensions |
| **60–79** | Advanced | Strong presence with broad coverage |
| **40–59** | Intermediate | Verified in several areas, some gaps remain |
| **20–39** | Emerging | Early participation or limited coverage |
| **0–19** | Minimal | Few or single attestations verified |

<br>

## 🔐 Privacy & Verifiability

VRS is fully **privacy-preserving**.  
- Publicly reveals only the overall score, verified platforms, and dimension coverage.  
- Keeps all personal data, numerical values, and sensitive credentials private.  
- Uses **zkPass zero-knowledge proofs** to confirm facts (e.g., “balance exceeds $5000”) without disclosing raw values.  

Every score can be independently verified, but never reverse-engineered to reveal private user data.

<br>

## 🚀 Why VRS Matters

- **Verifiable:** Reputation data is cryptographically provable.  
- **Fair:** Prevents single-platform bias and rewards well-rounded participation.  
- **Private:** Sensitive details are never exposed during verification.  
- **Interoperable:** Built for zkPass, but extendable across other Web3 ecosystems.  
- **Future-Ready:** Enables decentralized reputation for identity, governance, and credit systems.

## 💡 Summary

The **Verifiable Reputation Score (VRS)** introduces a new standard for digital trust —  
combining **multi-source reputation**, **verifiable computation**, and **privacy-by-design** principles.

> “Your digital reputation, verified — without revealing a thing.”
